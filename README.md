# NamechangeSimulator
Bukkit plugin to simulate name changes by changing the username in the Gameprofile that Mojang's AuthLib returns while a player logs in.

This could be used as a nick system as it stores the fake names after logouts and restarts and includes checks for the availability of such name with Mojang. But the main purpose is for testing how other plugins react to namechanges without having to buy/own a lot of accounts (or to have friends).

**Please note that this is an extremely experimental plugin! Use at your own risk!**

## Downloads

Development builds can be downloaded here: https://ci.minebench.de/job/NamechangeSimulator/

## Building

You can build the project with maven. It directly depends on Mojang's library repository at https://libraries.minecraft.net/ to be able to change AuthLib instead of having to depend on pre-compiled Spigot or CraftBukkit jars.
